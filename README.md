 ADITU implements a numerical method for the calculation of sound pressure levels in bounded and unbounded fluid domains. It is an Object-Oriented C++ software that stores objects using ASCII text files. Each object is entered using an individual file with a list of points and properties generated by the pre/postprocessor GiD (https://www.gidhome.com). The software is split into two sequential applications: 
 
The first one (aurre.cpp) takes as input several files of extension pun generated by GiD corresponding the coupled fluid objects of the model. It creates and stores an ObjektuPuntu class object for each file and its output consists of an ObjektuAdi class object for each of the fluid objects. These ObjektuAdi class objects contain the result for each object as a series expansion of the solution. 

The second one (ondoren.cpp) takes as input the ObjektuAdi class objects generated, and its output consists of a text file of extension flavia.res that can be directly postprocessed by GiD.
